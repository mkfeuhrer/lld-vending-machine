# Vending Machine - LLD Golang

## Introduction

This project is a part of the Low Level Design (LLD) learning series, where we design a Vending Machine in Golang. The Vending Machine is a complex system that supports multiple products, accepts various denominations of coins and notes, dispenses products, returns change, keeps track of product quantities, handles multiple transactions concurrently, provides an interface for restocking products and collecting money, and handles exceptional scenarios.

## Requirements

- Supports multiple products with different prices and quantities.
- Accepts coins and notes of different denominations.
- Dispenses the selected product and returns change if necessary.
- Keeps track of the available products and their quantities.
- Handles multiple transactions concurrently and ensures data consistency.
- Provides an interface for restocking products and collecting money.
- Handles exceptional scenarios, such as insufficient funds or out-of-stock products.

## Technologies Used

- Golang
- Concurrency
- Data Structures
- Object-Oriented Programming

## How to Use

To use the Vending Machine, follow the instructions in the code and run the program. The Vending Machine will prompt you for the product you want to buy and the amount you want to pay. It will then dispense the product and return change if necessary.

- Ensure you have Go installed
- Run `go run main.go`
